This repository contains my C# practice programs created using Visual Studio Code and the .NET SDK.

To run any program:
1. Open terminal in the project folder.
2. Use command: dotnet run
   (If it's a single .cs file, install dotnet-script and run: dotnet script filename.cs)

Each file demonstrates basic C# concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.
